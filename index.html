		<h2>Powerful Tool to Enhance Your Guest Experience</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks"></i>
			<h3>Manage</h3>
			<p>SnowCloud's cloud-based platform makes scheduling, reservations, and sales more efficient and convenient for everyone at your resort.  Partners can manage their entire snow sports school from any computer or mobile device and can complete sales and reservations from anywhere.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i>
				<h3>Instant Booking</h3>
				<p>Your resort guests love your instructors, but it's inconvenient to book with their favorite instructors over the phone or in-person. Partnering with SnowCloud enhances the guest experience by letting guests book and confirm a lesson with their preferred instructor for a specific date and time. Guests can interact with their instructor before, during, and after the lesson creating a deeper connection and increased likelihood for repeat visits.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i>
			<h3>Cloud Based</h3>
			<p>SnowCloud is a cloud-based platform. This means we never need to install costly software on your computers. We don't charge for individual software licenses and you can access the SnowCloud platform from as many computers, tablets, smartphones, etc, as you'd like! The devices constantly sync so that your schedules and sales are up to date on every device.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i>
			<h3>Interact</h3>
			<p>Enhance the engagement between your guests and your snow sports school by offering your guest a tool to directly book your instructors. Guests can chat with the instructor before the lesson to get information and advice before the start of the lesson, and interact after the lesson is completed to receive additional suggestions, tips, and to schedule future lessons!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></i>
			<h3>On The Go</h3>
			<p>Using SnowCloud's mobile apps, your snow sports school can sell lessons from anywhere at the resort. Payment and administrative information is collected through the app, and the guest never has to go back to the school to sign up! Now, when you see a guest struggling and in need of a lesson, it's easy to approach them and offer to start a lesson at the tap of a button! If your guest realizes they need a lesson, they can also request a lesson through our apps from anywhere at the resort.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="row">

				<div class="container">
					<label>Q: What exactly is SnowCloud?</label>
					<p>A: SnowCloud is a web and mobile platform in the ski and snowboard industry offering a comprehensive reviews/ratings system for ski and snowboard instructors, as well as an instant online and mobile booking platform for lessons. Now, your guests can book and confirm their favorite instructors at the tap of a button and your snow sports school employees can put down the phone and get out on the snow!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: How does SnowCloud benefit my resortâ€™s guests?</label>
					<p>A: SnowCloud gives resorts an additional channel for reservations and sales in the snow sports school. Much like OpenTable, SnowCloud offers an interactive web and mobile platform for directly booking and confirming individual instructors for specific dates and times without ever having to pick up the phone or visit the snow sports school desk.</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: How does SnowCloud benefit my resort internally?</label>
					<p>A: SnowCloud's cloud-based platform makes scheduling, reservations, and sales more efficient and convenient for everyone at your resort. Partners can manage their entire snow sports school from any computer or mobile device and complete sales and reservations from anywhere.
					</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: So, does SnowCloud supplement or replace our existing systems?</label>
					<p>A: Either! SnowCloud offers our own cloud-based platform that can replace all of the functionality in your snow sports school from sales, reservations, scheduling, reports, and more. Since weâ€™re in the cloud, you can access the platform from anywhere with a computer or mobile device and manage sales and reservations while on the snow! If you choose to continue using your existing systems, we can easily supplement them by offering your guests direct and precise bookings for individual instructors and specific dates and times. Your guests will no longer have to pick up the phone to schedule private lessons, and your snow sports school staff can spend more time teaching and less time scheduling!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: We already pay tens of thousands of dollars for our current in-house systems, Iâ€™m not sure we can pay for moreâ€¦</label>
					<p>A: No worries. We know how costly those old 90â€™s style softwares are for licensing, support, and whatever else they can charge you for! Thatâ€™s why our pricing model is purely commission based. We charge $0 setup fees, no subscription fees, no on-boarding fees, and weâ€™ll NEVER charge you for support! Weâ€™re in the cloud, so we can troubleshoot for you from here in Los Angeles!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: Great! So how will this change things for our snow sports school guests and why do they need to book online anyway?</label>
					<p>A: Your guests love booking online. They probably book all of their travel, restaurant reservations, car services, and more online. Right now, they canâ€™t book their ski or snowboard lesson online. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re here for. Itâ€™s no secret that your guests are quite tech-savvy in this industry, and they are much more likely to book online/mobile if the option is there, rather than having to call up your snow sports school and go through the tedious process of booking over the phone!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: What else does SnowCloud do?</label>
					<p>A: Weâ€™d love to tell you! But only you, not everyone (yet). Shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:hugh@snowcloud.ski">hugh@snowcloud.ski</a>. Weâ€™ll get you on your way to a web demo and show you how 2016 style technology can truly change your resort experience before, during, and after the visit for your guests!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: Who is behind SnowCloud?</label>
					<p>A: Weâ€™re a team of passionate skiers and snowboarders. We love the sport as much as you do, and our goal is simply to help the industry grow by leveraging technology in order to better engage with the new tech-savvy consumer who hates picking up the phone!</p>
					<br>
					<label>Q: We want more information, how can we connect?</label>
					<p>A: Subscribe to our mailing list <a href="#">above</a> for updates. Send us an email to <a href="mailto:hugh@snowcloud.ski">hugh@snowcloud.ski</a> and we will be in touch to schedule a demo of the platform. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
